## About me

I study how authoritarian governments demolish democracy and the rule of law and what can be done to stop them. I'm a political scientist interested in democratic backsliding, especially in Central Eastern Europe, European Union politics, and judicial politics. In particular, I study elite decision-making in various contexts, creating academic work with policy relevance. 

Currently, I am working on the [Judicial Resilience Project](https://verfassungsblog.de/judicial-resilience-project/) of [Verfassungsblog](https://verfassungsblog.de) and have contributed to the award-winning [Thuringia Project](https://verfassungsblog.de/the-thuringia-project/) before. I am a [re:constitution fellow 2024/25](https://www.reconstitution.eu/en/fellows/detail/20242025/etienne-hanelt), pursuing my project '_Castles of Illiberal Thought and Mercenary Thinkers: Academic Legitimation of Authoritarian Politics in Hungary_'. I also work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Judicial Studies Institute at Masaryk University on the ERC-funded [NET-ROL](https://net-rol.eu) project (_Networks and the Rule of Law: Uncovering Socio-Economic Outcomes_). Before, from September 2021 to January 2025, I worked there as a pre-doctoral researcher on the [INFINITY](https://justin.law.muni.cz/en/projects/infinity-2021-2026) project (_Informal Judicial Institutions: Invisible Determinants of Democratic Decay_). 

I have finished a DPhil at the University of Oxford with a thesis titled '_Supranational Tug of War: Overcoming the European Union's Authoritarian Equilibrium_'. At the University of Oxford, I was one of the founders and convenors of a graduate discussion group  (_OxonCourts_) that served as an interdisciplinary forum for researchers working on judicial institutions across the University. I represented for 3 years non-tenured researchers and graduate students at Wolfson College. This involved me in virtually all aspects of College governance and strategy. In 2019, I was elected as the Chair of the General Meeting – the Common Room President – and participated in this capacity in many committees dealing with issues as diverse as academic affairs, communications, the College premises, equality and welfare as well as social and cultural matters. I was also twice elected to the Governing Body (2019–21) and served for two years on the General Purposes Committee (2018–20).

I hold degrees in Political Science from Friedrich Schiller University Jena (M.A., B.A.) and have studied as a graduate exchange student in Michigan and South Korea. My master's thesis was awarded the Jena Political Science Department's best thesis award in 2016. Before joining Oxford, I taught classes in political science at Jena.
